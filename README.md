- Title: Data Preprocessing (Cleaning), Then Visualization
- Objective:
  + To perform data cleaning and visualization on a dataset, ensuring its quality and facilitating insightful analysis.
- Tools Used:
  + Python for data processing and visualization.
  + Libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Subprocess, and csv.
- Tasks:
  + Curling the raw data (High school exam scores 2020) at https://diemthi.hcm.edu.vn/ using subprocess.
  + Handle special characters (using Unicode) and outliers.
  + Delete extra characters and blank lines, "tags" pair.
  + Visualize the cleaned dataset using Matplotlib for exploration and analysis.
     + Which subject is chosen the most? (bar chart).
     + How many subjects do students take in their exams? (bar chart)
     + Average scores of subjects. (pie chart)
     + Average scores of subjects by age group. (line chart)
     + Which surname is the most common? (bar chart)
- Knowledge Utilized:
  + Proficiency in Python programming, including data manipulation and visualization.
  + Understanding data cleaning techniques, such as handling special characters, outliers, and deleting extra characters and blank lines, "tags" pair.
  + Familiarity with data visualization principles and tools.
- Project Description:
  + This project involves cleaning a dataset to ensure its quality and reliability for analysis.
  + Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis as it ensures accurate and meaningful results.
  + After cleaning the data, visualization techniques are applied to gain insights and communicate findings effectively.
- Working Principle:
  + Curl the dataset and identify data quality issues.
  + Address missing values by imputation or removal.
  + Handling outliers using appropriate methods.
  + Handle special characters (using Unicode) and outliers.
  + Delete extra characters and blank lines, "tags" pair.
  + Visualize the cleaned dataset to explore relationships and patterns.
- Outcome:
  + A clean dataset ready for analysis and visualization.
  + Insights gained from visualizations aid in decision-making and further analysis.
  + Improved understanding of data cleaning techniques and visualization principles.
